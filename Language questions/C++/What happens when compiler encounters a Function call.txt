When a program is compiled, the compiler converts each statement in your C++ program into one or more lines of machine language. Each line of machine language is given its own unique sequential address. This is no different for functions -- when a function is encountered, it is converted into machine language and given the next available address. Thus, each function ends up with a unique address.
