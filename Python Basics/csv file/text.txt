Working with csv files:  (comma seperted values).
Here the values are seperated by commas and hence comma is a delimiter.
First import the csv module.
open the csv file with the mode we want. To open this file syntax is same as that of opeaning the .txt file.

csv.reader(filename, delimiter)
csv.writer(filename, mode, delimiter)
csv.writerow(list or tuple)
csv.DictReader(filename, delimiter)
